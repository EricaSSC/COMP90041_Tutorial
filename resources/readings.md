### **7. Terminate a function VS Terminate the program**

 - `return;` statement is used inside a method to come out of it. It returns from the function to its caller and the program continues running.
 - `System.exit();` terminates the program; control does not return to the caller.
	 - System.exit(0) is used in any method to come out of program. System.exit(0) terminates the program **normally**.
	 - Whereas System.exit(1) terminates the program because of some **error** encountered in the program.
